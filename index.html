          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Based on the graph available on the D3 challenge page, the findings typically reflect correlations between
            health-related risks and demographic factors such as age, income, and poverty levels. The specific observations include:
            
            Income vs. Health Risks:
            Individuals with lower incomes tend to have higher health risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and lack of access to 
            healthcare. Income is inversely proportional to health risks, indicating that as income levels increase, the prevalence 
            of these risks decreases.
            
            Age vs. Health Risks:
            Older age groups often show a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions compared to younger demographics. Certain 
            behaviors like smoking might decrease with age, while issues like obesity and healthcare challenges might persist or 
            increase in older populations.
            
            Poverty Levels:
            States or regions with higher poverty levels exhibit higher overall health risk factors.
            This trend highlights a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and public health outcomes.</p>
